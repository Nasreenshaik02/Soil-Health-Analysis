Soil Health Analysis for Increasing Crop Production 
Soil health plays a crucial role in determining agricultural productivity, directly impacting crop yield and sustainability. This project focuses on developing a Soil Health Analysis System using machine learning and Data Science techniques to evaluate soil conditions and provide optimized recommendations for crop selection and fertilizer application. The system analyses key soil parameters, including pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium(K), moisture, and temperature, to assess soil fertility. By leveraging classification algorithms such as Random Forest and Decision Trees, the model predicts the most suitable crops for a given soil profile. Additionally, a chatbot interface is integrated to assist farmers by providing real-time insights, allowing them to input soil data and receive personalized recommendations. The proposed solution aims to enhance agricultural decision-making, improve resource utilization, and promote sustainable farming practices. By adopting AI-driven soil health analysis, farmers can maximize crop yield while minimizing environmental degradation, leading to increased efficiency and profitability in agriculture.
