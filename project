Literature Survey : Soil Health Analysis for Increasing Crop Production

Soil health plays a crucial role in agricultural productivity, influencing plant growth, nutrient availability, and ecosystem sustainability. The concept of soil health encompasses biological, chemical, and physical properties that determine soil functionality and its capacity to support plant life. In recent years, researchers have emphasized the importance of systematic soil health analysis as a fundamental approach to enhancing crop production.

Existing literature highlights that soil degradation, nutrient depletion, and declining organic matter content pose significant challenges to global food security. Studies have demonstrated that soil health indicators—such as pH, nutrient levels, soil organic carbon, microbial diversity, and soil structure—directly impact crop yields. Various soil testing methods, including laboratory-based analyses, remote sensing, and in-field assessments, have been developed to evaluate these indicators and guide sustainable soil management practices.

Advancements in precision agriculture, biofertilizers, organic amendments, and conservation practices have been widely explored as strategies for improving soil health. Researchers have found that integrating these approaches with comprehensive soil health assessments can enhance nutrient availability, improve water retention, and promote long-term agricultural sustainability.

This literature review examines the existing body of research on soil health analysis and its implications for increasing crop productivity. By synthesizing findings from recent studies, it aims to provide a deeper understanding of effective soil management strategies that contribute to sustainable agricultural growth.

Key Parameters of Soil Health
1. Soil Physical Properties
Soil texture, structure, and bulk density influence water retention, root penetration, and aeration. Compaction reduces root growth and restricts water and nutrient uptake (Brady & Weil, 2016).
2. Soil Chemical Properties
Soil pH affects nutrient availability and microbial activity (Fageria et al., 2011).Essential macronutrients (N, P, K) and micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn) are crucial for plant growth. Organic matter enhances cation exchange capacity and soil fertility (Lal, 2015).
3. Soil Biological Properties
Microbial diversity supports nutrient cycling and plant health.  Mycorrhizal fungi improve phosphorus uptake and drought resistance (Smith & Read, 2008).Enzyme activities are indicators of soil microbial function and fertility.
3. Water Management
Efficient irrigation techniques (e.g., drip irrigation) prevent nutrient leaching and soil erosion.

This section details the methodology for model selection for soil health analysis.
4.3 Methodology: Model Selection and Integration with Chatbot
Step 1: Define Objective
The objective is to identify suitable machine learning models that can accurately analyze soil health parameters and provide actionable crop recommendations via a chatbot.

4.4 Feature Engineering and Selection
Feature engineering and selection form a critical backbone of any machine‐learning pipeline. In the context of soil health analysis—where raw measurements (e.g., pH, nutrient concentrations, texture) need to be transformed into meaningful predictors—these steps directly impact model accuracy and interpretability. When combined with a conversational chatbot interface, well‐engineered features ensure that farmers receive reliable and actionable insights. This section outlines, in detail, the systematic methodology for crafting, evaluating, and selecting features in a soil‐health‐driven predictive system.
4.4.1 Overview and Objectives
•	Objective: Derive and select a compact, high‐quality set of features that:
1.	Capture the underlying soil‐crop relationships.
2.	Improve model performance (classification/regression) for predicting soil fertility and crop recommendations.
3.	Facilitate interpretability—so the chatbot can explain why certain suggestions are made.
•	Context: Inputs come from soil laboratory tests, remote sensing data, farmer‐reported values, and possibly weather or geospatial data. The final features will be fed into machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) and then exposed through a chatbot interface so that end‐users (farmers) can query and receive recommendations based on their specific soil profile.
4.4.2 Step 1: Raw Data Audit and Understanding
1.	List All Available Variables
o	Physical parameters: Soil texture (sand/silt/clay percentages), bulk density, moisture content.
o	Chemical parameters: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), macronutrients (N, P, K), secondary nutrients (Ca, Mg, S), micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn).
o	Biological parameters (if available): Microbial biomass carbon, enzymatic activities.
o	Auxiliary data: GPS coordinates, elevation, crop history, irrigation type, weather/historical rainfall, remote‐sensed indices (e.g., NDVI).
2.	Assess Data Quality
o	Missingness: Determine which features have missing values (e.g., some farmers may not provide micronutrient assays).
o	Measurement units and scales: Ensure all nutrients are reported in consistent units (e.g., mg/kg or ppm).
o	Outliers and anomalies: Spot improbable values (e.g., pH outside the 3.5–9 range).
o	Data distribution: Plot histograms or boxplots for each attribute to identify skewness or heavy tails.
3.	Define Target(s)
o	Potential target variables:
	Soil fertility class: “Low,” “Medium,” “High”—based on a composite fertility index.
	Recommended crop yield (continuous).
	Fertilizer dosage recommendation (multiclass or continuous).
	Crop choice suggestion (categorical: e.g., “Maize,” “Wheat,” “Soybean”).
o	Label Generation: If using historical yield data, compute actual yields per plot and define target thresholds (e.g., top third yield = “High Yield”).
4.4.3 Step 2: Feature Engineering (Creation of New Variables)
Feature engineering takes raw measurements and domain knowledge to produce variables that carry stronger predictive signals.
2.1. Domain‐Knowledge‐Driven Transformations
1.	Ratios and Indices
o	Nutrient Ratios:
	N:P ratio, N:K ratio, P:K ratio.
	Ca:Mg ratio (critical for soil structure and nutrient uptake).
o	Base Saturation Percentage (BSP)
BSP=Ca+Mg+K+NaCEC×100\text{BSP} = \frac{\text{Ca} + \text{Mg} + \text{K} + \text{Na}}{\text{CEC}} \times 100BSP=CECCa+Mg+K+Na×100 
(where CEC = cation exchange capacity).
o	Soluble Salts Index
Soluble Salts≈EC5\text{Soluble Salts} \approx \frac{\text{EC}}{5}Soluble Salts≈5EC 
(a simplified estimate when EC is given in dS/m).
2.	pH‐Based Categorical Buckets
o	Define a new feature “pH_class” with values:
	“Strongly acidic” (< 5.5)
	“Moderately acidic” (5.5 – 6.5)
	“Neutral” (6.5 – 7.5)
	“Alkaline” (> 7.5)
o	This bucketed variable can be useful for certain decision‐tree models to quickly split on pH categories rather than continuous pH.
3.	Soil Texture Classes
o	If raw data include sand%, silt%, clay%, derive the standardized USDA texture class (e.g., “Loamy sand,” “Sandy loam,” “Clay loam”).
o	One‐hot encode these texture classes (e.g., texture_LoamySand, texture_SandyLoam, etc.).
4.	Organic Matter Indices
o	Convert organic carbon (OC) to “Organic Matter Percentage” using the Van Bemmelen factor (OC × 1.724).
o	Then bucket:
	“Very low OM” (< 1.5%)
	“Low OM” (1.5 – 3.0%)
	“Medium OM” (3.0 – 5.0%)
	“High OM” (> 5.0%)
2.2. Statistical Transformations
1.	Log or Box-Cox Transform for Skewed Variables
o	Nutrient concentrations (e.g., P, K) often follow a right‐skewed distribution.
o	Apply log(P + 1) or Box–Cox transformations to reduce skewness, especially if using linear models.
2.	Standardization and Scaling
o	For algorithms sensitive to scale (e.g., SVM, KNN), compute
Xscaled=X−μXσXX_\text{scaled} = \frac{X - \mu_X}{\sigma_X}Xscaled=σXX−μX 
where μ and σ are the training set mean and standard deviation.
o	Keep track of scaling parameters so that at prediction time the chatbot can apply the same transformation to farmer‐provided inputs.
3.	Polynomial or Interaction Terms
o	Create second‐order interaction features (e.g., pH × OC, N × Moisture) if domain knowledge suggests synergistic effects (e.g., nitrogen availability changes with organic carbon).
o	Be cautious: only generate interactions when they are likely to capture non‐linear effects, and use feature‐selection methods (below) to avoid explosion of dimensionality.
4.	Temporal or Geospatial Aggregations (if data exist)
o	If you have time‐series of soil tests, compute “delta” features, e.g., ΔpH = pH_today – pH_last_test.
o	If geospatially referenced, compute neighborhood‐level averages (e.g., average nutrient levels within a 500 m radius) to capture local spatial trends.
4.4.4 Step 3: Handling Missing Values and Imputation
1.	Missing Indicator Flags
o	For each variable with missingness, create a binary flag: feature_N_missing_flag = 1 if N is missing, 0 otherwise.
o	This allows models to learn from the fact that certain tests were omitted.
2.	Imputation Strategies
o	Simple Imputation:
	Numeric: Replace missing nutrient values with median (preferred over mean if distribution is skewed).
	Categorical: Replace missing texture class with “Unknown” or the mode.
o	KNN‐Based Imputation:
	Identify the k‐nearest neighbors (based on other complete features) and impute using the neighbor average. Useful if missingness is not random.
o	Model‐Based Imputation:
	Train a small regression (e.g., Random Forest regressor) to predict missing N from other nutrients/features. Use this only if a substantial fraction of records have all other features intact.
o	Document meticulously which imputation strategy is used, so that at inference time (when a farmer enters a partial soil report), the chatbot pipeline can replicate the same imputation.
4.4.5 Step 4: Initial Feature Set Compilation
At this stage, compile a “master” feature table that includes:
1.	Raw features (e.g., pH, EC, N, P, K, OC, sand%, clay%, silt%)
2.	Engineered features (e.g., N:P ratio, BSP, pH_class, texture_one‐hot columns, OM_percentage)
3.	Imputation flags (binary missing indicators)
4.	Scaled/transformed versions (e.g., log_P, scaled_N, etc.)
5.	Interaction terms (only if generated)
6.	External features (e.g., local rainfall, NDVI average for the last 30 days)
This complete feature matrix might initially have 30–50 columns (depending on the number of raw and engineered attributes).
4.4.6 Step 5: Feature Selection (Pruning Irrelevant or Redundant Features)
Reducing the feature set to only those variables that have significant predictive power is vital to avoid overfitting, reduce computational cost, and enhance interpretability for the chatbot’s end‐users.
4.4.6.1. Filter Methods
1.	Correlation Analysis
o	Compute the Pearson (or Spearman) correlation matrix among numeric features.
o	For any pair of features with high absolute correlation (|r| > 0.9), drop one of them—typically the one that is less interpretable or less correlated with the target.
o	Example: If log_P and P are both present and nearly perfectly correlated, drop raw P if using log_P in downstream models.
2.	Univariate Statistical Tests
o	ANOVA (for categorical targets): For each numeric predictor, compute its F‐statistic in a one‐way ANOVA across soil fertility classes. Retain features with p‐value < 0.05.
o	Chi‐Square (for categorical features vs. categorical target): For bucketed features (e.g., pH_class), run a χ² test to see if the distribution differs significantly across target classes.
3.	Variance Thresholding
o	Eliminate features with near‐zero variance (e.g., if > 95% of records share the same value). Such attributes carry little information.
4.4.6.2. Wrapper Methods
1.	Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
o	Choose a base estimator (e.g., Random Forest or Logistic Regression).
o	Run RFE to recursively remove the least important feature(s) until a desired number of features remains (typical ranges: 10–20 features).
o	Use cross‐validation to decide the optimal number of features (e.g., via grid search over “number_of_features_to_select”).
2.	Sequential Feature Selection
o	Forward Selection: Start with zero features; iteratively add the feature whose inclusion yields the greatest cross‐validated improvement in the evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy or MAE).
o	Backward Elimination: Start with all features; iteratively remove the feature whose removal degrades performance the least, until a stopping criterion is reached (e.g., drop until performance falls below a threshold).
4.4.6.3. Embedded Methods
1.	Model‐Based Feature Importance
o	Tree‐Based Models:
	Train a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting model on all features.
	Extract feature importances (e.g., mean decrease in impurity or SHAP values).
	Select the top k features (e.g., top 15) based on importance ranking.
o	Regularized Linear Models:
	Fit a Lasso (L1‐regularized) regression (for continuous targets) or L1‐regularized logistic regression (for classification).
	Features with non‐zero coefficients are deemed important.
2.	SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Analysis
o	Use SHAP values on a tree‐based model to gauge each feature’s contribution to model output, averaged across all samples.
o	Retain features with large absolute mean SHAP values. This method highlights features that consistently drive predictions, which can further be communicated via the chatbot (“Your soil’s high organic matter contributes strongly to this recommendation”).
4.4.7 Step 6: Final Feature Set and Validation
1.	Aggregate Results of Selection Methods
o	Create a short‐list of features that consistently appear in multiple selection approaches (e.g., appear in top 20 of RFE, have p < 0.05 in univariate tests, and ranked high by SHAP).
o	Aim for a final feature count that balances parsimony and predictive power (often 10–20 features in soil‐health contexts).
2.	Hold‐Out Validation
o	Split the original dataset into:
	Training set (e.g., 70%)
	Validation set (e.g., 15%)
	Test set (e.g., 15%)
o	Fit the chosen model(s) (e.g., Random Forest) on the training set using only the final feature subset.
o	Evaluate performance (e.g., accuracy, F1 score for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression) on the validation set.
o	If performance satisfies the predetermined thresholds (e.g., accuracy > 85%, or RMSE < 10 kg/ha for yield prediction), lock in the feature set. Otherwise, revisit Steps 4–6 to adjust.
3.	Cross‐Validation
o	Perform k‐fold cross‐validation (k=5 or 10) on the training set to ensure stability of chosen features and model performance.
o	Record average and standard deviation of metrics. If variance is high (e.g., ±5% accuracy swings), consider adding back certain features or reducing complexity.
4.	Interpretability Check
o	Ensure each retained feature has a reasonable agronomic interpretation (e.g., “N:P ratio is crucial because an imbalance can limit crop uptake”).
o	Document for each feature:
1.	Why it was engineered/selected.
2.	How it influences the final recommendation logic.
4.4.8 Step 7: Integration with Chatbot Pipeline
Once the final feature set and model are determined, the chatbot integration proceeds as follows:
1.	User Input and Real‐Time Feature Computation
o	Chatbot Prompt: “Please enter your soil test results: pH, N (kg/ha), P (kg/ha), K (kg/ha), organic carbon (%), sand%, silt%, clay%.”
o	Backend Processing:
1.	Validate Inputs: Check if user‐entered values fall within expected ranges. If not, prompt for correction.
2.	Imputation: If certain values are missing, apply the same imputation strategy used during training (e.g., median replacement + missing_flag).
3.	Engineering: Compute engineered features in real time:
	N:P ratio = N_input / (P_input + ε)
	Organic matter percentage = OC_input × 1.724
	pH_class ← bucket(pH_input)
	One‐hot encode soil texture if user provided sand/silt/clay.
	Log‐transform P and K if required (e.g., log(P_input + 1)).
	Compute any additional interaction terms (e.g., pH_input × OC_input).
4.	Scaling: Standardize each numeric feature using the stored μ and σ from training.
2.	Model Prediction
o	Pass the final feature vector into the serialized (e.g., pickle) model (e.g., a Random Forest).
o	Obtain:
	Probability or score for each target (e.g., probability of “High Fertility”).
	Predicted class (e.g., “Medium Fertility,” “Recommend Soybean,” or a numeric yield estimate).
3.	Explainable Output
o	Use SHAP or permutation feature importance to generate a simple explanation for the end‐user:
	“Your soil’s N:P ratio of 3.2 (above ideal of ~2.0) contributes to this recommendation. Because P is relatively low, we suggest applying DAP fertilizer.”
o	Structure chatbot responses to highlight top 2–3 most influential features:
4.	Data Logging and Feedback
o	Log user inputs, computed features, model prediction, and eventual farmer‐reported outcomes (e.g., yield at season end).
o	Use these logs to periodically retrain/update feature engineering rules (e.g., if a new nutrient test becomes commonly available) and to detect concept drift (e.g., soil properties changing over years).
4.4.9 Step 8: Monitoring and Iterative Refinement
1.	Performance Monitoring
o	Track model accuracy (or RMSE) on real‐world usage data.
o	If performance degrades (e.g., farmers continually report surprising low yields), re‐evaluate feature distributions and consider new engineered attributes (e.g., weather‐based moisture stress index).
2.	Feature Drift Detection
o	Periodically compare summary statistics (e.g., mean pH, median N) in new data vs. training data.
o	If features drift significantly (e.g., average pH increases across the region), re‐run the feature selection pipeline to ensure selected features remain predictive.
3.	User Feedback Loop
o	Encourage farmers to rate the chatbot’s recommendations (“Was this fertilizer suggestion helpful?”).
o	Use user feedback as a weak “label” to refine feature selection—e.g., if farmers consistently reject advice when organic matter is low, consider designing a new feature around organic residue management practices.
4.5.0 Summary of Key Best Practices
1.	Leverage Agronomic Expertise
o	Always ground engineered features in agronomic principles (e.g., why N:P ratio matters for specific crops).
o	Document each feature’s rationale so the chatbot can “explain” suggestions in layman’s terms.
2.	Avoid Over‐Engineering
o	Resist the temptation to generate hundreds of interaction terms. Start with the most plausible combinations (e.g., nutrient × pH) and prune aggressively.
o	Use statistical tests and model‐based importance to validate each engineered variable’s utility.
3.	Maintain a Reproducible Pipeline
o	Version control feature‐engineering scripts and record exact transformations (e.g., log base, scaling parameters).
o	In the chatbot backend, encapsulate the entire transformation sequence (imputation → ratio → bucket → scaling) in a single “feature‐processing” module so that no step is inadvertently skipped.
4.	Transparency for the Farmer
o	Since smallholder farmers may distrust opaque “black‐box” systems, ensure that the chatbot’s wording always ties a recommendation back to a tangible property (e.g., “You have low potassium in your field; here’s why that matters…”).

Results and Performance Analysis

7.1 Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score)
When implementing a chatbot for soil health analysis, its performance is crucial to ensure accurate recommendations that can positively impact crop productivity. The chatbot typically uses machine learning (ML) or natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze user queries, interpret soil parameters, and suggest appropriate interventions. To evaluate the performance of these models, two primary metrics are used:
1. Accuracy
Definition:
Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.
Formula:
Accuracy=TP + TNTP + TN + FP + FN\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP + TN}}{\text{TP + TN + FP + FN}}Accuracy=TP + TN + FP + FNTP + TN 
Where:
•	TP: True Positives
•	TN: True Negatives
•	FP: False Positives
•	FN: False Negatives
Application in Soil Health Chatbot:
For example, if the chatbot is predicting the suitability of a fertilizer based on soil test data, accuracy tells us how often it gets that recommendation right.
If the chatbot gives correct responses 87 times out of 100 interactions, then:
Accuracy=87100=87%\text{Accuracy} = \frac{87}{100} = 87\%Accuracy=10087=87% 
Limitation:
Accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets. For instance, if 90% of the soil samples are “healthy,” a model that always predicts "healthy" will have 90% accuracy but will miss unhealthy cases.
2. F1 Score
Definition:
F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the trade-off between them, especially useful for imbalanced data.
Formula:
F1 Score=2⋅Precision⋅RecallPrecision + Recall\text{F1 Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision + Recall}}F1 Score=2⋅Precision + RecallPrecision⋅Recall 
Where:
•	Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
•	Recall (Sensitivity) = TP / (TP + FN)
Application in Soil Health Chatbot:
Let’s say the model predicts "low nitrogen" conditions.
•	Precision tells us how many predicted “low nitrogen” cases were truly low.
•	Recall tells us how many actual “low nitrogen” cases the model captured.
A high F1 score (e.g., 0.91) indicates that the model is doing well in both capturing actual issues and not over-predicting them.
Why F1 Score is Crucial:
In soil analysis, missing a deficient nutrient (false negative) can hurt productivity, and incorrectly recommending a treatment (false positive) can increase costs. F1 balances both risks.
 Why Both Metrics Are Important in Soil Chatbot Evaluation
Metric	Importance	Use Case in Chatbot
Accuracy	Measures overall correctness	General user response validation
F1 Score	Measures robustness in skewed data	Predicting soil deficiencies, disease likelihood, etc.
Example: Soil Health Chatbot Classification Task
Suppose the chatbot classifies soil samples into:
•	Healthy
•	Nitrogen Deficient
•	Phosphorus Deficient
And we test it on a validation dataset of 1000 samples.
Class	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
Healthy	0.91	0.93	0.92
Nitrogen Deficient	0.86	0.79	0.82
Phosphorus Deficient	0.84	0.77	0.80
Overall Accuracy: 89.2%
This tells us:
•	The model is quite accurate.
•	F1 Scores show where the model struggles (e.g., lower recall for phosphorus).
Final Note
When designing or evaluating a soil health chatbot, these metrics help:
•	Ensure reliable, data-driven advice for farmers.
•	Identify areas needing model improvement.
•	Provide a quantitative benchmark for future versions of the system.
7.2 User Testing Results
 What is User Testing in this Context?
User testing is the process of evaluating the real-world usability and effectiveness of the soil health chatbot system by collecting feedback and interaction data from end-users (e.g., farmers, agronomists, soil scientists). It helps validate not just technical performance (like F1 Score or Accuracy), but actual impact, clarity, and ease of use for its target users.

7.3 Response Time & Efficiency
In the domain of soil health analysis, especially when deployed as a chatbot to assist farmers and agricultural professionals, response time and system efficiency are crucial metrics. These directly impact user experience, adoption rate, and the effectiveness of timely decision-making in agriculture.
1.Response Time Analysis
Definition:
Response time refers to the duration between the user query input and the chatbot's first meaningful response. It includes:
•	NLP processing
•	Backend data retrieval (e.g., soil database)
•	Model inference
•	Response generation

Observed Response Times (During Testing)
Query Type	Avg. Response Time (sec)	Performance Class

•	Ambiguous user queries such as "Why are my crops dying?" without proper context.
•	Limited ability to follow up or probe for clarification in conversational flow.
Example: Misinterpreting “soil is weak” as a nutrient issue instead of a structural problem.
 b. Voice Input Accuracy
•	Low recognition accuracy in noisy environments (e.g., farm fields with wind, machinery).
•	Problems with code-switching (mixing English and local language in one sentence).
•	Delay in processing voice input on slower mobile networks.
 c. Soil Report Format Variability
•	Many farmers receive lab test results in various unstandardized formats (PDF, handwritten notes, regional formats), making parsing difficult.
•	OCR (Optical Character Recognition) struggles with scanned low-quality or regional-script documents.
 d. Limited Localized Data
•	In some regions, soil classification maps or crop advisory databases are outdated or incomplete.
•	Chatbot recommendations may not be fully accurate in newly developed or reclaimed agricultural lands due to a lack of historical soil data.
 2. Connectivity and Infrastructure Issues
a. Poor Internet Access
•	Many rural users experience slow or intermittent network connectivity, impacting response time and ability to use features like:
o	File upload (for soil test reports)
o	Voice input/output
o	Weather-based crop advisory
 Result: High user drop-off rates in low-connectivity zones.
 b. Device Limitations
•	Older or low-end smartphones may:

o	Not support features like speech recognition or file parsing.
 3. User Adoption & Behavior Issues
 a. Digital Literacy Gaps
•	Many users are not familiar with:
o	Using chat interfaces
o	Uploading documents or speaking clearly into a microphone
o	Interpreting chatbot outputs and translating them into action
 Farmers often rely more on verbal, human guidance from extension officers.
 b. Trust and Cultural Barriers
•	Users may distrust automated recommendations, especially if they contradict advice from local agronomists or traditional practices.
•	Skepticism around AI-driven decisions without seeing clear short-term outcomes.
 c. Lack of Contextual Awareness
•	The chatbot often lacks knowledge about:
o	Current crop stage unless explicitly mentioned
o	Pest history, recent weather events, or neighboring field conditions
This can lead to generic or partially correct advice.
